                <strong>Relationship Psychology</strong><br/>
                <ul>
I have been dedicatedly interested in relationship science including all human bonding and close relationships issues. Mating, attraction, romantic relationships, marriage, friendship, and parenting are all in my research scope.
<br><br>

My master thesis was about attachment and cultural marriage types (see <a href="https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=veR1mHu9yoWjwcVUjCEoPFXSg8cIyKUzdWHTwMn5Cn5Nc0oXEto2e5cqgctwOEMl">Gundogdu-Akturk, 2010</a>) and (see <a href="https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=RrI-Krk3A-RkF4YfHofuk4Z7EN06H8UE54uUF_7RTisdUewVde4DdmcJY9ToDJqE">my PhD dissertation</a>) was related to the discrepancy between one’s ideal mate standards and actual mate mismatch, and relationship outcomes (see my PhD thesis and <a href="https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/1078659">Gundogdu-Akturk, 2021</a>). 
<br><br>

I collaborated with other researchers from different countries to research the link between subjective commitment to a relationship and how people responded to hypothetical betrayals of that relationship (see <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616664694">Cheung et al., 2016</a>).
<br><br>

I am also interested in different methods in relationships science. To name a few, I studied on partner emotion coregulation using daily-diary methods (see <a href="https://pdf.trdizin.gov.tr/pdf/enVOR1doWm1qYlVoZkFoeVhvKzB6YUFxeWNaWERleGczNHFyRDhnZGt3SjRNOW5COXlVaFBkUW5PYXZhazVrYk54UnhabmJrSTJqdk9FOGkwWlhCMlhFZk0yT3Z0SFlnT1plRkEycDdCbk5ZVzk2d2FETlZmMmpnS2FRbzJtTGpNbURlYnlNSnVEUW96ZGFVcm5hc3c5dzlneW1SbTJsMlZXdWhpdno1ZkI3NDhLZ0Q3UzJQaFBCUWg4YlM1Si9Wa3k0ejVEc2V6alAzVmF0dTI5Z1J4NDdEVjlwdFpTL3FiUDZxRjNFeFRQVk11Zm9oSEQ4ZkYxN09kWitjMzNXdGd0ZjBVRzdtT1d3Z3RRPT0">Gundogdu-Akturk & Aykutoglu, 2020</a>) and have an ongoing project with my colleagues on mating strategies, in which we collect data using speed-dating techniques.
<br><br>

Parenting practices and their correlates with children is another research area that excites me and grabs my attention. My interest in this subject started with a review article we prepared (see <a href="https://www.psikolog.org.tr/tr/yayinlar/dergiler/1031828/tpy1301996120100000m000131.pdf">Sumer et al., 2010</a>) and increasingly continue as I became a parent. I supervised in number of students’ graduation projects on this topic. I took trainings and certifications, and I convey my knowledge on this subject to my students with a course content covering "sustainable parenting practices".
<br><br>

In addition, I have 3 book chapters under the titles of Attachment Theory and Close Relationships in Adulthood, Diversity in Close Relationships, and Attraction, Mating and Evolutionary Psychology, one of which has been published by an international publisher and two are in press.
                </ul>
              
                 <br>
              
              <strong>Health Psychology</strong><br/>
                <ul>
Knowing that interpersonal relationships have long been concerned as the quality of our relationships, our psychological adjustment, physical health, and day to day well-being; I have been motivated to study on health issues and relationships also. For instance, our study with women with breast cancer, which had findings of significant associations between receiving support from an important person (partner or spouse) during treatment and coping strategies was one of them. (see <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105309342295">Bozo et al., 2009</a>).
<br><br>
My interest in the link between physical health and psychological processes continued, and my colleagues and I had another study in which we examined the relationship between coping, optimism, and post-traumatic growth in patients with breast cancer. (see <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223980.2012.654520">Buyukasik-Colak et al., 2012</a>).
<br><br>
Nowadays, I mostly keen on mindfulness and the link between mind-body interaction and either physical or mental health. I am working on designing research that examines the relationship between close relationship appraisals, mind-body interactions, and health.
                </ul>
                 <br>

              <strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br/>
                <ul>
As a social psychologist, various topics have been inclusive of my research interests. In this context, together with my colleagues, we conducted small-scale research on various subjects and presented their findings at national and international congresses. For example, relationships between personality traits, attachment, and time perspective orientation were one of them (presented at <a href="https://www.ecp2015.it/">14th European Congress Psychology, 2015</a>). The study of gender roles and children's toy selection (presented at <a href="https://10times.com/play-and-toy">International Play and Toy Congress, 2015</a>) and the study of parasocial relations in our lives (presented at <a href="https://www.ichus.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ozet-Kitabi-12.pdf">IV. Psychology and Art Symposium</a>) are also within the scope of these studies.
