                <strong>Academic Skills in Psychology</strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    This course is designed to help students gain scientific and critical thinking, reading, writing, and presentation skills. It aims to develop skills in academic research, reading and evaluating scientific articles, reviewing literature, identifying sections of a scientific paper, and writing these sections using APA (American Psychological Associations) style with professional language, presenting reviews or empirical study results. Additionally, the course provides students with professional skills that they can use in their career journeys, such as writing resumes, personal statements, and cover letters.
                </ul>
              
                 <br>
              
              <strong> Experimental Psychology</strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    The title of Experimental Psychology contains two basic meanings together. The first corresponds to the term "Method" for the application of "Experiment" to psychology research. The second is a general name of a very broad and often interdisciplinary field that covers various sub-specialties such as Learning, Attention, Perception, Memory, and Cognition. In this context, this course covers detailed examinations of experimental methods and techniques, as well as different areas of practice.
                        <ul>
                        <br>
                        <strong> Part I - Experimental Methods and Learning & Memory</strong><br/>
                        This part includes a consideration of major theories and research results related to learning and memory in humans and animals. The goal of this course is to understand theories about how human beings learn (encode), store, and retrieve (remember) all the amazing things we can remember. To do this (and to gain historical perspective), the research experiments which led to these theories, including extensive research with animals are discussed.
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                        <strong> Part II - Sensation & Perception</strong><br/>
                        This part aims to cover how our experiences are created by our senses and how we use these experiences to interact with our environment. Learners gain information about the complex process of seeing, hearing, feeling touch, tasting, smelling as well as attention and perception of motion, color, depth, and speech.
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>

              <strong> Research Methods in Psychology </strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    This course provides learners with basic features of research in psychology including quantitative and qualitative research methods, scientific research steps and models, experimental design, data collection techniques, data analysis and reporting, and internet research. (Students require to take basic statistic and academic skills courses). Although this is not a statistics course, the goal is also to integrate statistical analyses that go with each kind of design so that the analyses students learned in statistics courses become less abstracted.
                </ul>
                 <br>

              <strong> Close Relationships / Human Bonding </strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    This course serves students who have accomplished fundamental psychology courses and desire to have more information about human affectional bonds. The course provides students with understanding the underlying mechanisms of social relationships. It covers multi-disciplinary topics primarily within the context of psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of developmental, social, and cognitive psychology, and secondarily within the scope of ethology, anthropology, sociology, and neurobiology. Thus, the topics of attachment, romantic love, and the characteristics of happy relationships, as well as the dark sides of relationships such as jealousy, cheating and separation are covered in a multi-disciplinary manner.
                </ul>
                 <br>

              <strong> Applied Social Psychology </strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    This course is designed to cover the topics that includes applying social psychological theories and techniques into social problems, and to demonstrate the use of theoretical approaches in various social settings (e.g., organizational, legal, educational). The course aims to improve social psychological skills to develop effective policies for social problems and encourage prosocial behavior. In this sense, it is answered the question of how we can use social psychology to build a society of happy, healthy, wise, and good individuals.
                </ul>
                 <br>

              <strong> Parenting </strong><br/>
                <ul>
                    This course is a communication lesson that focuses important aspects of parent-child relationship and communication, and it discusses sustainable good parenting practices from childhood to adolescence. The course starts with students’ self-evaluations of their relationships with parents and continues by addressing the intricacies of healthy and dysfunctional parent-child communication. From sleep communication to eating problems, from risky behaviors to sexuality issues; the course covers functional communication techniques specific to situations that parent-child pairs may encounter in different developmental processes. Focusing on healthy communication, this course also aims to contribute to learners’ personal development as a parent, psychologist, specialist or adult. For this purpose, it is an applied course that includes field studies, in-class discussions and practices, awareness studies.
